Excited to share my latest pet project with you guys!
I've been looking for a CoverFlow app for Windows and couldn't find anything except for a few tutorials.

What is CoverFlow? 

It used to be a feature on macOS and iTunes that let you view your files and music albums like a cool carousel.
Too bad we haven't seen it in years. But well, armed with Cursor and some can do spirit I managed to hack together what I think is a pretty neat viewer.

Features:

View JPGs, PNGs and MP3s
Smooth, keyboard-friendly navigation and fast previews
Local library scanning and small, efficient indexing, the .exe is super tiny
Simply integrates into the Explorer Context Menu
Small footprint - optimized for responsiveness on Windows
There is also some customization via the Registry:


Still BETA as I am figuring C# out...

I think it might crash if a folder has more than 600 images or if there's some file formats that it doesn't support.
But already enjoying it and using across my computer :P
